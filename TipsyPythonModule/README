This is the C++ source code for a Python module to expose Tipsy files.
To build and use it, you must:
1.) Also have the 'structures' module, which you can get from the same CVS
server you got this from.
2.) Have Boost.Python built and installed and know its particulars, in order to
complete steps 3 and 4.  You need to place the shared libraries somewhere in
your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
3.) Edit variables in the files 'Jamrules' and 'boost-build.jam' to point to
your copy of Boost and the tools/build/vq directory of Boost, respectively.
4.) Edit the file 'Jamfile', and make sure that the library names in the
definition of 'template external-boost_python' correspond to the shared
libraries that were created when you built Boost.Python
5.) Run 'bjam -sBUILD=release', which will compile the code and create a shared
library.  Copy the resultant library to somewhere convenient, and re-create the
convenience symlink.
6.) Set the environment variable PYTHONPATH to include the location of both the
Boost.Python shared library and the TipsyFile library you just built.
7.) Run python and do an 'import TipsyFile'
