# You may need to configure your compiler toolset, especially if you

# it is installed in a nonstandard place; see

# By default, boost_python and your extension/application will get build 
# in the 'bin' subdirectory of this project.  Thus, multiple projects
# will each build and use their own copy of boost_python.
# You can change this setting to specify a different tree to build in
# using the variable ALL_LOCATE_TARGET.  If multiple projects have 
# ALL_LOCATE_TARGET set the same, they will build into the same tree,
# sharing a single copy of the boost_python library.  Alternatively,
# you can use the technique shown in the examples of the Jamfile to build
# projects separately, all linking against a single copy of the boost_python
# library.
# For example:
# ALL_LOCATE_TARGET = $(HOME)/boost_projects ;
